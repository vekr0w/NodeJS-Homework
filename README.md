# NodeJS-Homework

Node application that returns the current weather and time in a given city.

To run this application you would first need to download/clone the source code from this repository.
You only need a recent nodeJS version. (It was tested on v17.4.0). There are no other dependancies.

You can run the file by entering the desired city as the value of this variable. `exports.city = "Bulgaria";`

Once you do that, just run node app.js.

This will run the app and do the following:
-Start a server on localhost:3000 and display the data as JSON.
-Display the data on the console.
-Create a new file output.txt(or update an already existing one) with the data
